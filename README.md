# releasecreation
temporary repository to test release creation workflows

We specifically would like to see if the procedure, offered by the github web interface, generates a lightweight git tag.
The procedure is documented here: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/

Besides that it is interesting to check wether a release package is
generated if we push a locally created git tag.
